# Chat GPT app for your iPhone (unofficial)

I got tired of opening chatGPT on Safari, so here's a simple app that is just a webview which shows the chatGPT site. 

## How to install (iOS): 

```
1) Clone this repo
2) Open ios/chatGPTMobile.xcworkspace in xcode
3) Plug in your iPhone
4) Set your build target to be your phone
5) Run
```

## Android
I haven't tested this on android but it'll probably work. 

## Limitations

I only tested this on my personal iPhone 14 pro with chatGPT on dark mode. So you might need to tweak the padding and stuff to get this right on your phone.

The following doesn't work: 
- Sign in with google
